    <div class="section_title"><h2>What factors go into a decision to launch?</h2></div>
        
        <p>The best time to start a mission is baed on a blen of factors:<br>
            the flight's targets and goals, the needs of the spacecraft, the type of rocket, and the desired trajectory, <br>
            which refers to the path the vehicle and spacecraft must take to successfully start the mission.</p>

    <div class="section_title"> <h2>What are the most common causes of scheduling changes in launches?</h2></div>
        
        <p>The most common causes of scheduling delays are related to the weather conditions, <br>
            e.g. strong winds can interfere with the rocket's attempt to follow a specific trajectory,<br>
            and temperature leaps can cause damage to the rocket's fuel.</p>
        
    <div class="section_title"> <h2>Where are the worldâ€™s major spaceports?</h2></div>
        
        <p>One of the most important spaceports is the "Guiana Space Center", located in French Guiana. <br>
            Located close to the Equator and with the shoreline to the East, <br>
            its position makes it one of the best spaceports to safely and effortlessly launch a rocket from.</p>
